Convert DTIF (Design Tree Interchange Format) into SVG representations, harnessing the capabilities of D3.js. While the current focus is on SVG and D3 integration, the project is evolving under the name DTOM (Design Tree Object Model).

DTOM offers a unique approach to managing and rendering design nodes in a structured and efficient manner, similar to how the DOM (Document Object Model) operates with HTML. This structure could pave the way for further expansions, potentially exploring custom WebGL or Canvas solutions for more advanced features like intricate filters.
