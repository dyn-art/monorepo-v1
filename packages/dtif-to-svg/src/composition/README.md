## Canvas Rendering Engine with D3.js and React

Our canvas rendering engine leverages the power of D3.js for manipulating documents based on data and the flexibility of React for building user interfaces. This architecture allows us to manage complex visualizations with a rich interaction of DOM elements and maintain high performance with large amounts of data.

### Structure

#### Composition

At the core of our architecture is the `Composition` class. This is the main entry point for all operations involving the visualization. The `Composition` maintains a list of all nodes (or visual elements) within it. This is done through a key-value map where keys are the unique IDs of nodes and values are the instances of corresponding `Node` classes. 

The `InteractiveComposition` also holds the `selectedNodes` property, which is an array containing the IDs of currently selected nodes in the scene. This provides a central source of truth for the state of the scene and allows for efficient updates and lookups.

#### Nodes

The `Node` class represents a single visual element in the scene. Each `Node` class can be a specific type such as `Rectangle`, `Circle`, `Frame`, etc., with their own unique properties like width, height, and position. Each `Node` also holds a reference to a D3 selection that represents its corresponding DOM node.

Node classes have methods to update their properties. These methods not only update the property values but also apply these updates to the corresponding D3 selection, thus reflecting changes in the DOM. 

Some `Node` classes like `Frame` have a `children` property that holds the IDs of its child nodes. This property helps in maintaining the hierarchical structure of nodes within the scene.

### Rendering and Updates

Rendering and updates in our architecture are a mix of D3 and React philosophies. We use D3's data-driven approach to manipulate and update the DOM nodes. This includes operations like setting the position, rotation, and other visual properties of nodes. 

On the other hand, we use React's diffing and re-rendering algorithms for updating the UI components. We leverage React's state management to reflect changes in the side panel that displays the properties of selected nodes. 

### Performance

Our architecture is designed to efficiently handle between 1 and 500 nodes. It avoids unnecessary loops and expensive operations by having a central source of truth in the `Scene` and only updating the nodes when necessary. It also ensures that only the parts of the UI that need to be updated get re-rendered.

### Node interactivity inherence with Mixins
The rendering works with a hierarchy of nodes, where each node has some common functionalities, and some functionalities are specific to certain types of nodes. This is a classic case where inheritance comes into play. However, the requirement to add interactivity to some node types, but not the base ones, makes this a potential case for the use of the mixin pattern.

#### What are Mixins?
A mixin is a class whose methods can be reused in multiple classes without causing a tangled web of inheritance. In this package mixins could be used to add interactivity to certain node types without affecting those that do not need this feature and thus allow tree shaking.

#### Code Complexity
While mixins provide a way to share behavior across classes, they can make the code more complex to understand. This is because you need to follow the mixin chain to understand all the functionalities that a class has. 

#### Collision and Overwriting
Another issue that could arise is the potential for method collision. If two mixins provide a method with the same name, one will overwrite the other.

#### Identity of Instance
TypeScript does not support multiple inheritance, and it doesn't consider an instance of a class using a mixin as an instance of the mixin itself. If you try using the `instanceof`` operator, it will not recognize an object as being an instance of a mixin. 

#### Wrap Up
In conclusion, while the mixin pattern provides a powerful way to share and reuse behavior across classes in TypeScript, it introduces too much complexity that isn't worth while for supporting tree shaking.

Example implementation:
```
function BaseNodeMixin<TBase extends Constructor>(Base: TBase) {
  return class extends Base {
    greetFromBaseNode() {
      console.log("Hello from BaseNode");
    }
  };
}

function InteractiveBaseNodeMixin<TBase extends Constructor>(Base: TBase) {
  return class extends Base {
    greetFromInteractiveBaseNode() {
      console.log("Hello from InteractiveBaseNode");
    }
  };
}

class BaseNode extends BaseNodeMixin(class {}) { }

class InteractiveBaseNode extends InteractiveBaseNodeMixin(BaseNode) { }

function ShapeNodeMixin<TBase extends Constructor>(Base: TBase) {
  return class extends Base {
    greetFromShapeNode() {
      console.log("Hello from ShapeNode");
    }
  };
}

function InteractiveShapeNodeMixin<TBase extends Constructor>(Base: TBase) {
  return class extends Base {
    greetFromInteractiveShapeNode() {
      console.log("Hello from InteractiveShapeNode");
    }
  };
}

class ShapeNode extends ShapeNodeMixin(BaseNode) { }

class InteractiveShapeNode extends InteractiveBaseNodeMixin(InteractiveShapeNodeMixin(ShapeNode)) {}

const shapeNode = new ShapeNode();
shapeNode.greetFromShapeNode(); // Outputs: "Hello from ShapeNode"
shapeNode.greetFromBaseNode(); // Outputs: "Hello from BaseNode"

const interactiveShapeNode = new InteractiveShapeNode();
interactiveShapeNode.greetFromInteractiveShapeNode(); // Outputs: "Hello from InteractiveShapeNode"
interactiveShapeNode.greetFromShapeNode(); // Outputs: "Hello from ShapeNode"
interactiveShapeNode.greetFromInteractiveBaseNode(); // Outputs: "Hello from InteractiveBaseNode"
interactiveShapeNode.greetFromBaseNode(); // Outputs: "Hello from BaseNode"
```
